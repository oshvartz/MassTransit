Once built, the routing slip is executed, which sends it to the first activityâ€™s execute URI. To make it easy and to ensure that source information is included, an extension method on *IBus* is available, the usage of which is shown below.

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    await bus.Execute(routingSlip);


It should be pointed out that if the address for the first activity is invalid or cannot be reached, an exception will be thrown by the *Execute* method.
